Hi, I’m **Armando**. I’m passionate about **business intelligence** and building **end‑to‑end analytics**: from extracting and automating data from heterogeneous sources, to designing **SQL/NoSQL** data stores, applying **statistics**, and turning insights into dashboards that support real decisions.

**What I do (end‑to‑end):**
- **Data integration & automation** (APIs, web scraping, operational files, ERPs) with reproducible pipelines.
- **Data modeling & quality**: relational schemas, NoSQL collections, consistency checks, and traceability.
- **Statistical analysis**: EDA, segmentation, forecasting, KPIs, hypothesis testing, and performance monitoring.
- **Visualization & storytelling**: dashboards, executive reporting, and clear narratives for action.

I’m **trilingual (ES/EN/FR)** and enjoy collaborating with **international, cross‑functional teams**—translating business needs into clear technical solutions.
